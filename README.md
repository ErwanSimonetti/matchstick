# matchstick

My work on Epitech's matchstick project. The project started on the 8th and finished on the 28th of March 2021.

The player and the IA take turns; each one can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.The losing one is the one to take the last matchstick.

If the user wins, the program returns 1.If the AI wins, it returns 2.

To try it, clone the repository, use the make rule at the root of the repository and execute the matchstick binary with a file containing a map as argument like in the following example:

    ./matchstick lines max_withdrawn
